## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.21 or higher
- Internet connection

### Building from Source

```bash
# Install the scraper
go install github.com/ayanrajpoot10/myipms-scraper
```

### Download Binary
Pre-built binaries are available for multiple platforms in the [Releases](https://github.com/ayanrajpoot10/myipms-scraper/releases) section.

## üéØ Quick Start

```bash
# Basic usage - scrape top domains globally
./myipms-scraper

# Filter by country
./myipms-scraper -country="United States"

# Filter by hosting provider
./myipms-scraper -owner="Cloudflare, Inc"

# Combined filters with custom output
./myipms-scraper -country="United States" -owner="Amazon.com, Inc" -output=aws-usa-domains.txt -pages=10

# Fast concurrent scraping
./myipms-scraper -country="United States" -workers=5 -delay=300

# Conservative scraping with single worker (classic mode)
./myipms-scraper -country="United States" -workers=1 -delay=1000
```

## üìä Filter Options

### Geographic Filters
- **Country**: Filter by country name (e.g., `United States`, `United Kingdom`, `Japan`)
- **IP Range**: Filter by IP address ranges or CIDR blocks

### Hosting & Infrastructure
- **Owner**: Filter by hosting provider or company name
- **Host**: Filter by specific hosting service
- **DNS**: Filter by DNS record type

### Performance Metrics
- **Rank**: Filter by popularity ranking range
- **Visitors**: Filter by visitor count range
- **URL**: Search for domains containing specific text in their URLs

## üåê Proxy Support

The scraper includes comprehensive proxy support for enhanced reliability and bypassing rate limits:

### Supported Protocols
- HTTP/HTTPS proxies
- SOCKS5 proxies
- Authenticated proxies

### Configuration Examples
```bash
# Basic proxy
./myipms-scraper -proxy=http://proxy.example.com:8080

# Authenticated proxy
./myipms-scraper -proxy=http://proxy.example.com:8080@username:password

# SOCKS5 proxy (Tor)
./myipms-scraper -proxy=socks5://127.0.0.1:9050
```

## ‚ö° Concurrent Scraping

The scraper now supports concurrent/parallel scraping for significantly faster results:

### Key Benefits
- **Faster Scraping**: Multiple pages processed simultaneously
- **Configurable Workers**: 1-10 concurrent workers (default: 3)
- **Smart Rate Limiting**: Adjustable delays to avoid server overload
- **Error Resilience**: Automatic retries and graceful degradation

### Concurrency Configuration
```bash
# Use 5 concurrent workers (recommended for fast scraping)
./myipms-scraper -workers=5

# Conservative approach with more delay between requests
./myipms-scraper -workers=3 -delay=1000

# Maximum speed (use with caution, may trigger rate limits)
./myipms-scraper -workers=8 -delay=200

# Classic sequential mode (single worker)
./myipms-scraper -workers=1
```

### Performance Guidelines
- **Default (3 workers, 500ms delay)**: Good balance of speed and stability
- **Fast (5-8 workers, 200-300ms delay)**: For bulk scraping with proxy/VPN
- **Conservative (1-2 workers, 1000ms delay)**: For avoiding rate limits
- **Maximum**: Up to 10 workers, but may trigger anti-bot measures

### Considerations
- More workers = faster scraping but higher chance of rate limiting
- Use appropriate delays to respect server resources
- Consider using proxies with high worker counts
- Monitor for IP rate limiting and reduce workers if needed

## üìà Performance & Reliability

### Built-in Rate Limiting
- Configurable delays between requests (default: 500ms)
- Intelligent backoff for rate limit detection
- IP rotation recommendations for large-scale scraping
- Concurrent processing with worker pool management

### Error Recovery
- Automatic cookie refresh when expired
- Captcha solving workflow for authentication challenges
- Resume capability from any page number
- Comprehensive error reporting and suggestions
- Per-page retry logic with exponential backoff

### Output Management
- Real-time progress tracking with worker statistics
- Configurable output files
- Automatic deduplication
- Statistics reporting for concurrent operations

## üîß Configuration

### Cookie Management
First-time users will be prompted to solve a captcha for authentication. Cookies are automatically saved and reused for subsequent runs.

## üìã Available Filters

## üö® Important Notes

### Rate Limiting & Best Practices
- The tool includes configurable rate limiting (default: 500ms delays)
- Concurrent scraping allows faster processing while respecting limits
- For large-scale scraping, consider using proxies or VPNs
- Respect the website's terms of service
- Monitor for IP rate limiting and adjust worker count/delays accordingly
- Start with default settings (3 workers, 500ms delay) and adjust based on results

### Authentication Requirements
- First-time usage requires solving a captcha
- Cookies are saved locally for future sessions
- Periodic re-authentication may be required

### Legal Considerations
- Ensure compliance with local laws and regulations
- Respect website terms of service
- Use scraped data responsibly and ethically

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Cookies Expired Error**
   - Solution: Run the captcha solving process again
   - The tool will automatically prompt for captcha resolution

2. **IP Limit Exceeded**
   - Solution: Use a proxy server or change your IP address
   - Consider using mobile internet with airplane mode toggle

3. **No Domains Found**
   - Check filter criteria for typos
   - Use `--list` to verify available options
   - Try broader filter criteria

4. **Connection Issues**
   - Verify internet connectivity
   - Check proxy configuration if using one
   - Consider firewall or DNS issues
